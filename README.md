## What is this?
Many-Api is essentially a gathering of multiple RESTful Api's which can be used by all.

Currently it has
- [x] ATLA Quotes
- [x] Jokes
- [x] Donald Trump Tweets from 8/12/20

We are always looking to add more api's!

## Want to Add to an Existing Api?

If you would like to help, submit a pull request and edit the .csv files located in the `data/csv/` directory, since that will then update the corresponding json file

## That's Pretty Much It

#### If you have used this api in any way, let me know so I can add it here

- [project-name](your-project-url) ([repo (if applicable) ](repo-url)): description

### Adding Your Project
Pull requests adding more projects to this list are welcome, just a few rules:
- Make sure the project cites this repo as an api source (with a link) 
- Follow this order `- [project-name](your-project-url) ([repo ](repo-url)): description`
- Try not to add extra blank lines, it breaks the formatting

 [Add your project to the list](https://github.com/Maanuj-Vora/Many-Api/edit/master/README.md)
