## What is this?

Many-Api is essentially a gathering of multiple RESTful Api's which can be used by all.

For the documentation and the usage of these api's, check it out [here](http://blog.maanujvora.me/categories/github-repositories/many-api/)

Implementation is [here](https://github.com/Maanuj-Vora/Many-Api-Implementation)

Currently it has

* [x] ATLA Quotes
* [x] Jokes
* [x] Donald Trump Tweets from 8/12/20
* [x] Coronavirus Data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)
* [x] Coronavirus Graphical Data
* [x] Marvel Cinematic Universe Quotes
* [x] Pokemon Stats
* [x] Garfield Comic Strips

We are always looking to add more api's!

### Documentation

Please note that all documentation can be found in the `examples/` folder. If you would like to contribute to the docuementation in a different language, please do so by submitting a pull request

---

### Todo

* [ ] Commenting the code base and making it more readable overall
* [ ] Editing the documentation and perhaps providing more examples
* [ ] Edit the Pok√©mon scraping script to make it more efficient
* [ ] Updating valid paths and documenting them

## Have an Idea for an Api?

Let me know so we can add that. Please do so by creating an issue with the `Feature Request` template so we can add it

---

## Want to Add to an Existing Api?

If you would like to help, submit a pull request and edit the .csv files located in the `data/csv/` directory, since that will then update the corresponding json file

---

## That's Pretty Much It

#### If you have used this api in any way, let me know so I can add it here

* [project-name](your-project-url) ([repo (if applicable) ](repo-url)): description

---

### Adding Your Project

Pull requests adding more projects to this list are welcome, just a few rules:

* Make sure the project cites this repo as an api source (with a link) 
* Follow this order `- [project-name](your-project-url) ([repo ](repo-url)): description`
* Try not to add extra blank lines, it breaks the formatting

 [Add your project to the list](https://github.com/Maanuj-Vora/Many-Api/edit/master/README.md)
