The Incredible Hulk|Emil Blonsky to Thaddeus Ross|"""I've run into bad situations on crap missions before. I've seen good men go down purely because someone didn't let us know what we were walking into. I've moved on to the next one, because that's what we do, right? I mean, that's the job. But this? This is a whole new level of weird. And I don't feel inclined to step away from it."""

The Incredible Hulk|Emil Blonsky and Thaddeus Ross|"""I'm a fighter, and I'll be one for as long as I can. Mind you, if I took what I had now, and put it in a body that I had ten years ago, that would be someone I wouldn't want to fight.""""I  can probably arrange something like that..."""
The Incredible Hulk|Soldier and Emil Blonsky|"""How are you feeling man?""""Like a monster."""
The Incredible Hulk|Emil Blonsky and Thaddeus Ross|"""Forgive me, sir? Doesn't anybody want to talk about what went down in there? 'Cause... He didn't lose us. And he was not alone sir. We had him. And then something hit us... Something BIG hit us! It threw a forklift truck like it was a SOFTBALL! It was the most powerful thing I've ever seen.""""Well, it's gone.""""Well, if Banner knows what it is, I'm gonna track him down, I'm gonna put my foot on his throat, and I'm gonna...""""That was Banner. IT was Banner.""""You have to explain that statement, sir.""""No I don't. You've done a good job. Pack up and get our men on a plane. We're going home."""

The Incredible Hulk|Kathleen Sparr, Samuel Sterns and Emil Blonsky|"""Are you telling me you can make more like him?""""No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces, but it's not like I can put together the same Humpty Dumpty if that's what you're asking. He was a freak accident! The goal is to it better!""""So Banner's the only—""""She's an annoying bitch.""""Why are you always hitting people? Now what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression?""""It's not what you've done. It's what you're gonna do. I want what you got out of Banner.

Godlike.""""Well, I want that. I need that. Make me that.""""I don't know what you've got inside you already. The mix could be an abomination. I didn't say I was unwilling.

I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve.""""Steve Rogers. Where are you from?""""Queens. 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway. Before that, Germany. This troubles you?""""No.""""Where are you from, Mr. Rogers? Mmm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus? Five exams in five different cities.""""That might not be the right file.""""No, it's not the exams I'm interested in. It's the five tries. But you didn't answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis?""""Is this a test?""""Yes.""""I don't wanna kill anyone. I don't like bullies.

Only a chance.""""I'll take it.""""Good. So where is the little guy from, actually?""""Brooklyn.""""Congratulations, soldier."""
Captain America: The First Avenger|Chester Phillips and Abraham Erskine|"""You're not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?""""I am more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.""""When you brought a ninety pounds asthmatic onto my army base, I let it slide. I thought, what the hell? Maybe he'll be useful to you, like a gerbil. I never thought you'd pick him. You stick a needle in that kids arm and it's gonna go right through him. Look at that. He's making me cry.""""I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.""""Do you know how long it took to set up this project?""""Yeah, I know.""""All the grovelling I had to do in front of Senator What's-His-Name's committees?""""Brandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.""""Then throw me a bone. Hodge passed every test we gave him. He's big, he's fast, he obeys orders.

Captain America: The First Avenger|Abraham Erskine and Steve Rogers|"""May I?""""Yeah.""""Can't sleep?""""I got the jitters, I guess.""""Me, too.""""Can I ask you a question?""""Just one?""""Why me?""""I suppose that is the only question that matters. This is from Augsburg. My city. So many people forget that the first country that the Nazis invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the...my people struggled. They...they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the...and the...And he...he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says ""You."" He says ""You will make us strong."" Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he's ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist. Schmidt must become that superior man.""""Did it make him stronger?""""Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.""""Thanks. I think.""""Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.""""To the little guys.""""No. No. Wait. Wait. What I am doing? No. You have a procedure tomorrow. No fluids.""""All right. We'll drink it after.""""No. "
Captain America: The First Avenger|Steve Rogers and Abraham Erskine|"""That wasn't so bad.""""That was penicillin."""

The Ghost|Holden Radcliffe and Leo Fitz|"""Now, this has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz. When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure on Coulson's hand, I knew— I knew right then that this was within reach.""""A robot?""""Not just a robot. It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side; pass for human."""
The Ghost|Aida and Leo Fitz|"""The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.""""To kill?""""No. I am incapable of that. I will protect. I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard... a shield."""

Uprising (episode)|Holden Radcliffe and Aida|"""Sorry if I'm being a snappy cat. Just been caught a bit unprepared, that's all.

Ah, yeah, she is all right, I guess. I prefer a classical beauty myself.""""She's so real. Her, her conversational responses, her range of motion.""""Those are weird things to say about a person.""""Fitz, she's an android. You do know she's an android, right?""""Yeah, of course I know that she's an android, 'cause I helped out. Why do you think her dynamic reaction force is so low?""""Why didn't you tell me?""""I wanted to.

Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire|Aida and Holden Radcliffe|"""May I ask you a question?""""Of course. Ask me anything.""""Why did Fitz lie to Agent May about where I'm from?""""You're still in the testing phase, Aida. The point of you is to pass for human. You must always act accordingly.""""But you programmed me not to lie.

Deals With Our Devils|Phil Coulson and Leo Fitz|"""I'm sorry. What did you mean 'not human'?""""Because Radcliffe and I built her, okay? Her mind can't be corrupted because it's just programming.

The Laws of Inferno Dynamics|Phil Coulson, Jeffrey Mace and Melinda May|"""Aida's an android.""""She's— What did you just say?""""An android.""""Had me fooled too.""""Well, that's... Okay, I mean, forget about the fact that I was mildly attracted to her, that totally goes against the Sokovia Accords. Doesn't anyone remember Ultron?"""
The Laws of Inferno Dynamics|Holden Radcliffe and Jeffrey Mace|"""They came through with flying colors, didn't they?""""Including you and Aida.""""Enough to earn her a reprieve?""""Enough to keep your program alive.""Well, thank you, sir, truly. You— you won't be disappointed.""""Before you thank me, you should know that I've asked Agent Nathanson to accompany Aida back to your lab to help patch her up, and to retrieve all of your research. From now on Doctor, all of your work on the LMD program will take place here under S.H.I.E.L.D. supervision.""""That's wonderful."""
The Laws of Inferno Dynamics|Aida, Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz|"""It's all right Agent Simmons; I won't bleed out. The synthetic blood is mostly for appearances.""""But you're in pain. I don't understand.""""Doctor Radcliffe programmed me to be a decoy.

Broken Promises|Aida to Melinda May|"""I'll play you music when I can. Studies show that listening to music increases dopamine levels by nine percent.

So unfortunately,  you'll have to stay here for now."""
Broken Promises|Phil Coulson, Holden Radcliffe, Jeffrey Mace, Leo Fitz and Alphonso Mackenzie|"""While we're handling the book, your mission is to accompany Doctor Radcliffe and erase Aida's hard drive.""""What?""""Aida read the Darkhold.""""We can't risk having any of its contents in her memory. It's too dangerous.""""Makes sense, although does seem a little bit unfair to Aida, considering how many lives she just saved.""""Okay. First of all, that thing is not a 'she' it's a damn robot. And second of all, what's the matter with you two chuckleheads? Have either one of you seen a movie in the last 30 years? The robots always attack.""""Well, technically speaking, Aida's not a robot she's an android.""""That's true.""""Android, robot - it doesn't matter what you call 'em. The end result's always the same: they rise up against their human overlords and go kill crazy."""
Broken Promises|Alphonso Mackenzie, Phil Coulson, and Holden Radcliffe|"""Well, book or no book, you're still a big dumb idiot for building that thing in the first place.""""Let's save that debate for another time. Right now, we need to find Aida and the first step is figuring out what she wants.""""Well, that's simple. She wants to live."""
Broken Promises|Alphonso Mackenzie, Holden Radcliffe and Phil Coulson|"""Looks like your creepiness finally works in our favor. Shouldn't be too hard to find your beautiful, weird, science, sex-bot.""""That's unfair, Mack. I've never had sex with Aida; we're just good friends.""""Good to know."""
Broken Promises|Leo Fitz and Holden Radcliffe|"""There was something different about her. It was like she was actually angry.""""No, I mean that's just impossible. I mean, Aida, she doesn't feel anything; she emulates. Her reactions are— are nothing more than approximations of emotions. It's pure mimicry.""""Yeah, well, that's just it. What if reading the Darkhold, somehow, made the emotions that Aida was mimicking real?""""Well, I mean, I can get how the book can pass knowledge along to it's reader, but human feelings? Now, that's like something from one of Mack's movies.""""Well it would explain why she's acting counter to our programming.""""Well, you're saying she's been overwhelmed with this— this flood of new emotions.""""Yeah, well, think about it. Fear, anger; they-they're powerful feelings. Feelings that make people kill, so can you imagine then being bombarded with them all at once.""""Fitz.""""I mean, we've had our whole lives to process complex emotions. Aida would've had days. It would be overwhelming.""""Dammit, that's enough!"""
Broken Promises|Leo Fitz and Holden Radcliffe|"""Aida is still just an android.""""Yeah, but is she? She has her own experiences, her own thoughts, now she even has free will. How than is she not a living being?""""It's just a theory.""""A theory we both know to be true. I mean, we're supposed to what, kill her? How does that not make us murderers?"""
Broken Promises|Alphonso Mackenzie|"""She did not just go all "
Broken Promises|Aida, Holden Radcliffe and Leo Fitz|"""I wasn't expecting you.""""Uh, change of plan, my dear Aida. Change of plan.""""Is everything okay, Leopold? You look sad.""""Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no. Everything's fine. Just, um, bit overwhelmed with work, that's all.""""I'm sorry to hear that."""
Broken Promises|Aida and Holden Radcliffe|"""I know what you're doing, Doctor. You came here to end my life.""""Well, that's not true, Aida. We simply wanted to make a few upgrades, that's all. The bloody hell?""""I made a few upgrades of my own."""
Broken Promises|Aida and Leo Fitz|"""I didn't like feeling pain, so I fixed that.""""Aida, whatever you're doing y-you gotta stop.""""Why would you wanna hurt me, Leopold? I was your shield."""
Broken Promises|Phil Coulson, Aida and Alphonso Mackenzie|"""Hello, Aida.""""It's nice to hear your voice Agent Coulson.""""Okay, this right here, this is exactly how The Lawnmower Man ends.""""What is it you want, Aida?""""The thing that gave me a soul.""""The Darkhold? Yeah, I'm sorry Aida; you've been acting a little off lately, so that's not gonna happen.""""I was afraid you'd say that."""
Broken Promises|Holden Radcliffe, Aida, Phil Coulson and Melinda May LMD|"""It's over, Aida.""""I did not kill anyone here. That was intentional.""""You murdered Nathanson.""""Nathanson insisted he reboot me before repairing my wounds. I regret what happened.""""Regret's not part of your programming.""""The Darkhold fixed that. It showed me regret and desire - so many astonishing things.""""It made you dangerous.""""I only wanted to help you."""
Broken Promises|Holden Radcliffe and Aida|"""To Aida.""""To Aida. Is everything okay, Doctor?""""It will be. It's just... We were so close. She had it in her hand, Aida. In her hand! She just couldn't get out with it.""""Your previous model had the Darkhold book in her hand.""""And all the answers it holds. I've only glimpsed it, but it opened my eyes to possibilities beyond my wildest imaginings. It can show us how—""""How to live forever.""""Well, it's a bit more complicated, but yes. Man could, once and for all, break the bonds of his mortal restraints.""""Is it still possible to make such a leap without the Darkhold?""""I'm afraid not which is why I took a chance and had Aida make a play for it. It was a risk we had to take.""""But she failed.""""Ah, through no fault of her own. She played her part to perfection, right down to my little speech about how the Darkhold was making her a real girl. Oscar-worthy stuff."""
The Patriot|Holden Radcliffe and Leo Fitz|"""She was designed for this very purpose. Aida was meant to save lives, prevent assassination attempts.""""Instead we just had a funeral for Agent Nathanson.""""Yeah, yeah. Painful loss, we all agree. But look, I can figure out what went wrong. Let me examine her. I'll pinpoint the problem—""""Radcliffe.""""—we can sort of restart the program.""""I don't think that's the best idea just now."""
The Patriot|Holden Radcliffe and Aida|"""Well, as long as we're not causing the poor woman any undue harm. There's been enough of that around. The last thing we need is another incident.""""You're referencing the actions I took to protect your secret.""""The protection I appreciate. The homicide was a bridge too far.""""My parameters place your security above all others. You would've been exposed.""""I was exposed when they found a corpse!""""If I terminate anyone else for your protection, I will dispose of the body more discreetly.""""No. Don't terminate anyone."""
The Patriot|Holden Radcliffe and Aida|"""Agent May is resilient. She never stops fighting, yet she showed more distress before she woke than during the fight.""""That's odd.""""No. It makes perfect sense. The flaw isn't in the hardware. It was in May herself. The simulation was rejected because Agent May thrives in conflict and chaos, not tranquility. She's a warrior.""""You're saying fighting against me stabilized her?""""Precisely. If we want her to accept the simulation, we need to give her an opponent to fight, an enemy to vanquish, a dragon to slay.""""Shall I design a dragon?""""No. I have something else in mind."""
The Patriot|Leo Fitz to Aida|"""Don't worry. I'm gonna figure out what broke you.""""Thank you, Fitz. Thank you."""
Wake Up|Aida to Melinda May|"""Perhaps you are going to be a problem after all."""

Self Control|Aida and Holden Radcliffe|"""I've observed much human behavior. And the more I see, the harder it gets to find a logic to it.""""Oh, you sweet girl, there is no logic to love, anger, wonder, joy—""""I understand the concepts, but I don't feel them myself. And unfortunately they've created a paradox in my programming.""""What do you mean? Explain.""""My two main parameters are in opposition due to human emotions. I was programmed to protect the Framework but also to preserve your life above all others.""""Well, how is that a contradiction?""""Because the greatest threat to the Framework, Doctor, is you."""

World's End|Ophelia to Quake|"""Hello, Daisy. I had a lot of time after you shattered my spine to think about what I'd do when I saw you again. I decided it might be fun to watch you kill yourself."""

He would never shut up. He was always bullying the new guys, stole cigs. But that day, he just kept talking to me...carried me back from the line. Hey. Hey. Wake up. Okay? Stay awake, okay? For the next couple hours, he stayed with me. When the Germans advanced, when the cold got so bad I thought we would freeze, he just kept telling me 'We are going home.'

Rabbit in a Snowstorm (episode)|Matt Murdock to the jury|"""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, forgive me if I seem distracted. I've been occupied of late with... questions of morality, of right and wrong, good and evil. Sometimes the delineation between the two is a sharp line, sometimes it's a blur. And often it's like pornography; you just know when you see it. A man is dead. I don't mean to make light of that, but these questions, these questions are vital ones, because they tether us to each other, to humanity. Not everyone feels this way. Not everyone sees the sharp line, only the blur. A man is dead. A man is dead. And my client, John Healy, took his life. This is not a dispute. It is a matter of record. A fact. And facts have no moral judgment; they merely state what is. Not what we think of them, not what we feel, they just are. What was in my clients heart when he took Mr. Prohaszka's life, whether he is a good man or something else entirely, is irrelevant. These questions of good and evil, as important as they are, have no place in a court of law. Only the facts matter. My client claims he acted in self-defense. Mr. Prohaszka's associates have refused to make a statement regarding the incident. The only other witness, a frightened young woman, has stated that my client was pleasent and friendly. And she only saw the struggle with Mr. Prohaszka after it had started. Those are the facts. Based on these, and these alone, the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that my client was not acting solely in self-defense, and those, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, are the facts. My client, based purely on the sanctity of the law, which we've all sworn an oath to uphold, must be acquitted of these charges. Now, beyond that, beyond these walls, he may well face a judgment of his own making. But here, in this courtroom the judgment is yours, and yours alone."""

He was alone in the world. In his private darkness. Surrounded by strangers. Yet he seemed fine during the day. He'd eat with the others... attend his classes, go to mass. But he was plagued by awful nightmares. He'd wake in a sweat, screaming. He didn't say what they were about. He'd just call out for help. So I'd go, and I'd hold his hand till he fell back asleep. But I have so many children under my care. Matthew wasn't the only one. His nightmares went on for months. One night, Matthew called for help and I didn't answer. I didn't go to him. He never asked us for anything again. He shut us out. Shut everyone out. Everyone in Matthew's life abandoned him. Including me.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who remembers his ""suggestion"" that we give some of our First Communion money to the poor box. And that was his way. To think of the community, and the, uh... and the individuals in it. To think in terms of, ""What can I give?"" He gave his life, right here in this church, protecting others. Standing up to a man who used fear as a tool to set neighbors against one another. If Father Lantom had an enemy, I would say it was fear. For me, personally, he spent many years trying to get me to face my own fears. To understand how they enslaved me, how they divided me from the people that I love. He counseled me to transcend my fears, to be brave enough to forgive... and see the possibilities of being a man without fear. That was his legacy.

And the Rider wants to send them both back to where they came from.""""I hope that means Hell.""""Hell is relative. Dimensions, space, planets it's all connected. Plenty of them qualify as Hell.

A Fractured House|Glenn Talbot to the United Nations|"""Now, I was here in 2012 when the sky tore open and the Chitauri rained down on us. Aliens. Aliens were running through the streets, and it was then that S.H.I.E.L.D. revealed themselves and stood with the Avengers, leading us to believe that we could put our faith in them, which we did. We stood idly by while they collected super-powered individuals, garnered alien weapons, built bases on virtually every continent. We thought S.H.I.E.L.D. was protecting us, but in truth, they took advantage of our good faith, and they still are."""

Love in the Time of HYDRA|Glenn Talbot|"""There is a mole on our base, this mole infiltrated security by posing as my wife and could be anyone in this room right now.

Absolution|Glenn Talbot and Holden Radcliffe|"""I can tell by your beady little eyes that you're a worm, so let me be absolutely honest with you.

The Ghost|Jemma Simmons to Melinda May|"""As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed. I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this."""
Broken Promises|Jeffrey Mace and Ellen Nadeer|"""If you have nothing to hide, I'm sure you wouldn't mind us taking a quick look around.""""Actually, I would mind.

The Patriot|Glenn Talbot|"""Actually, we used a modified version of that formula you confiscated from Agent Johnson's father."""
The Patriot|Glenn Talbot|"""The decision was made that the new Director had to be enhanced, no candidate fit that criteria. So we made one."""
The Patriot|Phil Coulson and Glenn Talbot|"""Really, Glenn?""""You should be thanking me. We're in the middle of an arms race. World War III is gonna be decided by whoever has more enhanced assets.

If you'd consulted me, I probably would have advised against that.""""Which is exactly why I didn't.""""Keep digging that hole, see how that works out for you.""""You needed a face for your poster. Fine. Your girl Daisy went rogue. The President tasked me with finding the next Captain America. Not an easy job, but I did it. I delivered a patriot A bona fide American hero!"""

I needed help with, um with lots of other things, and someone to talk through, at least. You gave up on me.""""I did no such thing.""""You told me you were gonna go see your mum and your dad, and then you went off to... For all I- for all I know, you could- something could've- you could've been killed. And because what? Because you think I'm useless?""""Of course I don't. That's not why I left.""""Well, then, why?""""Fitz I'm sorry."""
...Ye Who Enter Here|Jemma Simmons to Antoine Triplett|"""You're very lucky, Trip. If they hadn't used the clotting agent on your wounds... Well let's just say I'm glad they did."""
...Ye Who Enter Here|Jemma Simmons and Bobbi Morse|"""We were in the bottom of the ocean, in a storage pod, left for dead. And Fitz... he said something that caught me completely off-guard.""""Ah, those three little words.""""Yes! Well, no. I mean, not exactly. I barely had a moment to process what he said or how I felt about it, next thing I know, he's giving me the oxygen, water's rushing in and... He's ... He's laying there, in the hospital bed. He was so pale.""""How long was Fitz in the coma?""""Nine of the longest days of my life. When it finally broke, he couldn't speak. He just stared at me, confused. All I wanted to do was help him. All I wanted was... My best friend back.""""Your best friend?""""I never thought of him as anything else. That said, I can't imagine my life without him. It's all very confusing.""""You've never told him any of this, have you?""""Oh, lord no."""
Who You Really Are|Jemma Simmons, Leo Fitz, Alphonso Mackenzie, Bobbi Morse, and Lance Hunter|"""Skye is my friend. She's different.""""Oh, yeah. Like I was your friend, and then I changed. How did you handle that?""""Uh, t-the point is, secrets don't help any of us. Skye should have just come clean.""""What, and risked being locked up, studied, or who know what else? No, I wouldn't let her.""""Oh, you wouldn't let her.""""We could have handled her in a way that could have kept everybody safe.""""It wasn't fair to us, Fitz. We had a right to know.""""A right to know. What... is that the same way that Sif and the Kree had the right to know?""""I think the situation is a bit different, mate.""""No, you would have done to her exactly what they wanted to.""""You don't know that!""""Yes, I do know that! They would--you would--you'd ""handle her""! Mack just said! Like, uh... like Skye's something to be locked up in a cage somewhere. We should be protecting her.""""No, Fitz. We're the ones that need the protection from her."""
One of Us|Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons|"""I won't stay long, I just need to use the microwave. I didn't want to disturb May and her ex.""""Disturb them from...?""""They're in the kitchen, talking.""""What are they talking about? Is it about Skye's condition?""""No, it was of a personal nature. Seems that May isn't a good cook.""""Something Agent May doesn't excel at... interesting.""""Yeah, he teased her about it... she was laughing.""""Oh, he makes her laugh! Clearly she still likes him, and have you seen the way he looks at her?""""Yeah, I have eyes Jemma, of course I've seen.""""I wonder what happened between them, why end it?""""They're a bizarre pair. He listens for a living and she doesn't speak.""""True, but you know what they say about opposites."""
Love in the Time of HYDRA|Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons|"""What was in the case, Jemma?""""Something to help Skye.""""Because you want to change her, is that it?""""Stop it. I don't want to change Skye, the Diviner did that. I'm just trying to fix her."""
Love in the Time of HYDRA|Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons|"""Things change, that's what I'm saying, so maybe if you can learn to control this then you could have Avengers level powers. Something like Captain America even.""""I think it best we keep in mind the unstable nature of Skye's power. If there is an Avenger equivalent right now, I'm afraid it's the Hulk.""""Well, Hulk saved the world last I checked."""
Afterlife (episode)|Robert Gonzales, Jemma Simmons, Bobbi Morse, and Leo Fitz|"""Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, the ones that got away. I had my eye on you two when you were at the academy. I wanted to recruit you, but Coulson beat me to it. I heard he actually bribed Weaver with cupcakes. Robert Gonzales.""""We know who you are, and we are quite aware of your commendable reputation. Under different circumstances, we might even be flattered... Which is why this is so hard to comprehend.""""Under different circumstances, we would have preferred to be invited guests, but that forced our hand. We had to take it out of play.""""What's inside that's so important?""""All we know is that Coulson and Fury both believed it was valuable enough or dangerous enough to protect with extreme measures.""""Maybe it was their favorite recipes."""
The Dirty Half Dozen|Grant Ward, Leo Fitz, Melinda May, Phil Coulson, Jemma Simmons, and Daisy Johnson|"""Can we just address the elephant on the plane? I know. This is weird. Mistakes were made.""""By you.""""And people got hurt.""""By you.""""And I could stand here and explain again how my parents - and brother left me vulnerable...""""We've all had our traumas, Ward. Didn't turn any of us into psychopaths.""""Well, we all have our own ways of coping, don't we? For example, I was yours.""""Watch it, Ward!""""Look, I'm just saying we all made mistakes. Coulson handed me over to my abuser, thank you. Skye shot me.""""After you killed how many people?""""Yeah, and we were a team and a family, and you betrayed us!""""I know. It's what I regret the most. Not the lying, the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents I had to put down, and I'm sorry not even dropping you two in the ocean. It's this. My actions destroyed this.

Weren't we?""""(after a dramatic pause) I'm still happy I shot you.""""Yeah, me too.""""Should've aimed for the face."""
S.O.S. Part One|Phil Coulson and Jemma Simmons|"""Tell me you figured out what drugs Cal took, because my gut's saying everything ever made.""""I haven't fully sequenced the formula yet, if only for the multitude of trace drugs found, but my initial list includes anabolic-androgenic steroids, a liver enzyme blocker, various metabolic enhancers, methamphetamines, what appears to be gorilla testosterone, and, no lie, a drop of peppermint. I think it's an ill-conceived attempt at super strength.""""Other than Cap, every attempt has been ill-conceived."""
S.O.S. Part Two|Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz|"""You'll be careful?""""I won't be careful. I'll get the job done.""""Well, w-watch your back because I just saw Hunter with Bobbi, and it made me realize that I... Well, it's just that w-we never really spoke about what you said to me at the bottom of the ocean.""""This? Now? You want to talk about this now?""""No. We- We don't... Uh, it means a lot to me that we're friends again, and I, um, maybe when you get back, we could finally just talk about it.""""It's- There's nothing to discuss, Jemma.""""Maybe there is."""
S.O.S. Part Two|Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz|"""No, I don't. You keep rambling on and on, and I still don't know what you mean.""""Dinner.""""Fast approaching, yes, and we'll eat it, I'm sure.""""Yeah, no, no, no. But, uh, me and you ... maybe we could eat somewhere else, you know, somewhere... nice.""""Oh.""""Good. Okay. Uh, well, y... uh, you should come find me when you're finished here, and ... and I'll ... I'll start working on options to run by you... for that."""
Laws of Nature|Leo Fitz|"""Okay, listen, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. I've already lost a friend, and it may sound strange, but to get her back, I need to understand the properties of an ancient monolith."""
Laws of Nature|Yusef Hadad and Leo Fitz|"""This woman you went to all this trouble for... You love her, yeah?""""Yeah.""""Only love can make a man so stupid."""
Laws of Nature|Phil Coulson|"""You thought Simmons was trapped inside the monolith, but every instrument scan showed the stone was solid all the way through. After hearing about the Pym technologies disaster, you even thought she'd been reduced to a microscopic level. But no evidence supported that."""
Purpose in the Machine|Daisy Johnson, Leo Fitz, Phil Coulson, Bobbi Morse and Alphonso Mackenzie|"""So you think the rock is a portal?""""No. No, I'm proving that it's a portal, okay, to another planet, a-a very old planet a crack in space-time that carried Simmons away and carried the sand back.

But it's been months.""""Yeah?""""She could be long gone from wherever this thing dropped her.""""Yeah.""""She could be dead.""""Yes.""""But we're gonna find out, aren't we?""""Yeah.""""You're damn right."""
Purpose in the Machine|Andrew Garner to Melinda May|"""Your team pulled off a miracle today. Fitz got Simmons back. I thought you deserved to know. They think she's gonna be okay if you want to come back and see her."""
A Wanted (Inhu)man|Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz|"""I can't thank you enough.""""Yeah. It's a nice restaurant, isn't it?""""Yeah, but for more than that, for finding me.""""What else was I gonna do?""""I don't know what to say.""""You don't have to say anything."""
Devils You Know|Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons|"""Why do you want to rebuild the portal, Jemma? I saw the schematics, the data, the astronomical research you've been doing, and I just can't understand it. After everything you've been through, why would you-""""Because I have to get back there.

4,722 Hours|Jemma Simmons inspecting Maveth|"""This is Dr. Jemma Simmons, updating the file on the Monolith Fitz and I have been studying. I now know that it is an alternating matter-transportation device ... portal. Quite remarkable, really. I've been transported to an unknown planet in a different solar system. Air is breathable, oxygenated. Gravity seems to be slightly stronger... or I'm very tired. No, I think it's the gravity. The terrain is barren, desert-like. Although conditions seem favorable for terrestrial organisms, there's no immediate sign of life nor any noticeable vegetation or water."""
4,722 Hours|Jemma Simmons after capturing a Tentacled Creature|"""You're dinner, biatch!"""
4,722 Hours|Jemma Simmons|"""Everyone always said we could read each other's minds, Fitz. So I really need you to read mine right now. I'm alive. But I'm terribly alone and afraid. So I really need you to come and get me, okay? I know you won't give up, so I won't, either."""
4,722 Hours|Jemma Simmons to Will Daniels|"""You were right, Will. I saw It, whatever it is. Something was out there."""
4,722 Hours|Will Daniels and Jemma Simmons|"""That THING has been killing everyone that's come through here for centuries.""""How long have people known about the Monolith? And why keep sending people when there's no way back? It's as if they're being sacrificed!"""

Among Us Hide...|Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz|"""Fitz? I'm done helping Daisy.

I'm stronger than you think.""""No, no, no, no, Jemma, I have looked into it. Actually, I've run dozens of simulations, and I kept on hoping that one of them would work.""""Oh.""""I- I didn't want to disappoint you. The Monolith was just one option, though. We're not gonna give up, okay?""""I know this isn't easy for you. It's an odd situation.""""Yeah. It's one of the oddest, even for us."""" Fitz, if you knew Will, you'd understand.

Chaos Theory|Jemma Simmons' recording from Maveth|"""Fitz, hi. I don't know why I'm still talking with you why I'm recording myself. You're never gonna see this, are you? I still haven't found water, and it's, um well, I it's, uh I'm having trouble focusing, and I'm trying to stay positive. But I'm scared. I'm scared, Fitz. Do you remember when we first met? I do. You were so quiet and pasty, and so incredibly smart, handsome... Quite a strange feeling, isn't it? Never wanting to be without someone. You must have been so annoyed, me following you around all the time."""
Chaos Theory|Andrew Garner and Jemma Simmons|"""Looks like you're heading to the lab. That's a good sign, right?""""I'm trying. We're trying. Sometimes it just feels like it would've been best if I hadn't told Fitz everything.""""You did the right thing in telling the truth, Jemma. Secrets can eat you up from the inside."""
Chaos Theory|Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons|"""You okay?""""I couldn't sleep. There aren't a lot of windows in the base, and I wanted to-""""Watch the sunrise. I, uh I can't make any promises, but I think I may have found something. Might help us open up the portal.""""Really?""""And, um fixed your SIM card, so I heard your recordings and saw your video. Didn't know you thought about settling down in Perthshire. That's in Scotland.""""I know where it is, Fitz.""""So when you said all those things about... I mean, you were tired and dehydrated.""""I was as clearheaded then as I've ever been when I said all those things.

We wouldn't be able to conceive of three dimensions, of... of... of a... a cube or anything that's not 2-dimensional, okay? Yeah. Right, so, we flat paper people would perceive this 3-dimensional cube as many separate 2-dimensional moments. As time passing... the point on the line traveling through space and time.""""But, in fact, the cube, the line is fixed.""""Yeah, it's just sitting there. There's no future. There's no past.

But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don’t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That’s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor.

Of how tired we are, struggling to claw our way back to a middle class that no longer exist, because of those who take more than they deserve. And they keep taking, until all that's left for the rest of us is a memory of how it used to be before the corporations and the bottom line decided we didn't matter anymore. But we do.

The Samaritan tended to the travelers wounds, applying oil and wine. And he carried him to an inn, gave him all the money he had for the owner to take care of the traveler, as the Samaritan, he... continued on his journey.

Help those in need. And protect them from the forces that would do them harm. At first, it was selfish because my name was attached to it. But then it got bigger. If we try to protect only ourselves without looking out for those people closest to us, then we lose. Pop never forgot his people. Where some people saw hard rock kids, he saw precious jewels. He reminded me that diamonds are formed by pressure covered in dirt. But then you polish them and they shine. Pop saw the shine in everyone that walked in his barber shop. He cut their hair. He listened to their problems. And he made them feel better about the world and themselves. We have to strive on a daily basis to do the same for each other.

Thor: The Dark World|Odin|"""Long before the birth of light, there was darkness...and from that darkness came the Dark Elves. Millennia ago, the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith, sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night. Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether, an ancient force of infinite destruction. The noble armies of Asgard, led by my father King Bor, waged a mighty war against these creatures. As the Nine Worlds converged above him, Malekith could at last unleash the Aether...but Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp; without it, the Dark Elves fell. With the battle all but lost, Malekith sacrificed his own people in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army. Malekith was vanquished and the Aether was no more. Or so we were led to believe."""

That what you're worried about.""""Do you believe in the Devil, Father?""""You mean as a concept?""""No. Do you believe he exists? In this world, among us.""""You want the short answer or the long one?""""Just the truth.""""When I was in seminary... I was more studious than pious, more... skeptical than most of my peers. I had this notion... which I was more than willing to speak about, at length, to whoever I could corner... that the Devil... was inconsequential. Minor figure in the grand scheme.""""Not very Catholic of you.""""Uh-huh, yeah. In my defense, in the scriptures, the Hebrew word ""Satan"" actually means ""adversary"". It's applied to any antagonist. Angels and Humans, serpents and kings. Medieval theologians reinterpreted those passages to be about a single monstrous enemy. And, in my youthful zeal, I was certain I knew why... propaganda. Played up to drive people into the church.""""So you don't believe he exists.""""Am I done talking?""""Sorry.""""Years later, I was in Rwanda... trying to help local churches provide aid and sanctuary to refugees. I'd become close with the village elder, Gahiji. He and his family had the respect of everybody, Hutu and Tutsi alike. He'd helped them all... through famines, disease. The militia liked to force Hutu villagers to murder their neighbors... with machetes. But nobody would raise a hand against Gahiji. They said, ""Well,... how can we kill such a holy man?"" So the militia commander sent soldiers... with orders to cut his head off... in front of the entire village. Gahiji didn't try to put up a fight. Just asked for the chance to say goodbye to his family. By the time he was done, even the soldiers didn't wanna kill him. So they went to their commander and asked permission to shoot him. At least give him a quick death. The commander wanted to meet this man... who had won the respect of so many. He went to Gahiji... talked with him in his hut... for many hours. Then he dragged him out in front of his village and hacked him to pieces... along with his entire family. In that man who took Gahiji's life... I saw the Devil. So yes, Matthew... I believe he walks among us... taking many forms."""

Of who he is and what it would take to... do what I have to.""""And what did you learn?""""That he has someone he loves... who loves him, who'd mourn his loss.""""Mmm-hmm.

I will end up bloody and alone.""""You believe that?""""I'm not afraid of dying.""""Lot of people aren't, comes right down to it. It's living scares the holy crap out of 'em.""""You know what I do? Who I am?""""Sacrament of Penance, like I told you. Don't have to worry about-""""It's not what I'm asking.""""Yes, Matthew, I'm not an idiot. I have a pretty good idea who you are... and what you do. How you do it... That's something else entirely.""""Accident... when I was a kid. Used to think it was God's will.""""Used to?""""Yeah, he made each and every one of us with a purpose, didn't he? A reason for being.""""I believe so, yes.""""Then why did he put the Devil in me? Why do I feel it in my heart... and my soul... clawing to be let out... if that's not all part of God's plan?""""Maybe you're being called to summon the better angels of your nature. Maybe that's the struggle you're feeling... deep within you.""""And how do you know the angels and the Devil inside me aren't the same thing?""""I don't, but nothing drives people to the church faster than the thought of the Devil snapping at their heels. Maybe that was God's plan all along. Why he created him, allowed him to fall from grace... to become a symbol to be feared... warning to us all, to tread the path of the righteous."""

S.O.S. Part One|Phil Coulson and Jemma Simmons|"""Tell me you figured out what drugs Cal took, because my gut's saying everything ever made.""""I haven't fully sequenced the formula yet, if only for the multitude of trace drugs found, but my initial list includes anabolic-androgenic steroids, a liver enzyme blocker, various metabolic enhancers, methamphetamines, what appears to be gorilla testosterone, and, no lie, a drop of peppermint.

Neither of us would ever do anything to hurt our daughter.""""No. But you'd do anything to protect her. Look at yourself. Whatever was in these ...is killing you. Was getting rid of you part of her peace plan?""""You got it all wrong, Phil. That little concoction is my own special formula. I took it of my own free will. You see, when my Daisy was stolen, I wasn't strong enough to protect her, so I started experimenting. If I wasn't born with Inhuman powers, then I would make my own. Best-laid plans. C'est la vie. I never got it quite right ...always missing something. Highly unstable. Made me a little moody. Could it kill me? Sure.

It just came at me. But, like, the second it did, I knew... it was right. It was like this... this weight got... got lifted off my shoulders, you know? For both of us, you know? She knew it was right. The kids, too. I was just ready, you know? It was time. I just... I wanted to be with them. But that day, we went to that park, and the kids were too old for that stupid carousel, but that day they just laughed, you know? They were laughing. We were all laughing like idiots. And then... And that laughter, it stuck with me, you know? After I lost them, it would just... it would echo, you know? It was... over and over. And it wasn't just in my dreams. It was, like... it was in my heart, you know? And I just... I wanted to hold onto it. I wanted to live in it and just hear that laughter, but... thing is, I can't hear it anymore. It's all I had. It's gone. It's gone. You know, and all I have is... the looks on their faces after the bullets ripped through their bodies. You see, the thing is, Karen, is they had time, yeah? They didn't die straight away. They had time. My son, Frankie, you know, he... he tried to be brave, he tried to fight, but... my daughter, too. They just looked at me like... like, ""Why, Daddy?"" They didn't understand. Like, ""Why? Why?"""""

Avery and I were fresh out of the Academy. There were five of us running the back end until we lost communication with the first team. We had been searching. Found the senior agent up under a bridge. He managed to escape with a gunshot wound to the neck, but he bled out. He was still holding on to the 0-8-4. Poor thing was covered in blood. We thought she was dead too, but she was just asleep in a dead agents arms.""""Wait, the baby? The girl was the 0-8-4?""""If she had powers or something, we never witnessed it. The five of us helicoptered the kid off. Headed home. After we landed, we started getting crossed off.""""Executed.""""Tortured. Heads bashed in. Then when it came down to Avery and I, we realized that the only way to keep our people and the kid from being hunted-""""Was to erase her from existence.""""Avery was smart. She used to lead agents credentials to fake a level 8 clearance. She'd set up a nearly invisible protocol. The foster system was ordered to move the kid around every few months.""""But they still got to Avery.""""She died protecting that secret.""""And you left town.""""I left everything.

But all that time, it was S.H.I.E.L.D. protecting her. Looking after her. That's what she took away from the story. Not the family she'll never have, but the one she's always had. Here I am telling her something that could destroy her faith in humanity, and somehow she manages to repair a little piece of mind. The world is full of evil and lies and pain and death, and you can't hide from it. You can only face it. The question is, when you do, how do you respond? Who do you become?"""

Lockup|Melinda May to Daisy Johnson|"""I know what you're doing. Trying to distance yourself from everyone else so they don't drown in your wake? I invented that move.

The truth is, I can't hold the team together. But he can. Coulson wants me to call the shots in his absence? Well, that's my decision. Mack should call the shots. He has the biggest heart.
