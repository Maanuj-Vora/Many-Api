Iron Man|Tony Stark|'I don’t wanna see this on a Myspace page. Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up; I’m kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I’d be out of a job with peace.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark|'Is it better to be feared or respected? And I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries’ Freedom Line. It’s the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They… say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree! I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once! That’s how dad did it! That’s how America does it! And it’s worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chains and I personally guarantee you, the bad guys won’t even wanna come out of their caves. For your consideration: the Jericho.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark|'I never got to say goodbye to dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions that I would've asked him. I would've asked him how he felt about what this company did, if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we remember from the newsreels.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark|'Admit it-- This isn't the worst thing you've caught me doing. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them, and I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark|'I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do; and I know in my heart, that it's right.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark|'I am Iron Man.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark's Award Ceremony|'Tony Stark. Visionary. Genius. American patriot. Even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at seventeen, he graduated Summa Cum Laude from MIT. Then, the passing of a titan. Howard Stark's life long friend and ally Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder. Until at age 21, the prodigal son returns, and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries. With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting. Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry, by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe.'
Iron Man|James Rhodes|'As liaison to Stark Industries, I’ve had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend, and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this years Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark.'
Iron Man|Obadiah Stane|'Well, I’m not Tony Stark. But, if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel, and, uh, what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know, he, uh— the best thing about Tony is also the worst thing; he’s always working.'
Iron Man|Christine Everhart and Tony Stark|'You've been called the da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?'\n'Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.'\n'And what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?'\n'That's not bad.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark, Jimmy, Ramirez and Pratt|'I feel like you’re driving me to a court martial. This is crazy. What’d I do? I feel like you’re gonna pull over and snuff me. What? You’re not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!'\n'You can talk sir.'\n'Oh, I see. So it’s personal?'\n'No, you intimidate them.'\n'Good god, you’re a woman. I honestly, I couldn’t of called that. I mean, I’d apologize but isn’t that what we’re going for here? I thought it’d be as a soldier first.'\n'I’m an airman.'\n'Well, you have actually excellent bone structure there. I’m kinda… having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird? Come on, it’s okay, laugh. Hey!'\n'Sir, I have, I have a question to ask.'\n'Yes, please.'\n'Is it true you went twelve for twelve with last years Maxim cover models?'\n'That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but luckily the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else? You’re kidding me with the hand up, right?'\n'Is it cool if I take a picture with you?'\n'Yes, it is very cool.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark and Christine Everhart|'Okay, here’s serious. My old man had a philosophy. Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.'\n'That’s a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.'\n'My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.'\n'And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark and Pepper Potts|'Please don’t turn down my music.'\n'You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.'\n'How’d she take it?'\n'Like a champ.'\n'Why you trying to hustle me outta here?'\n'Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.'\n'That’s funny. I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.'\n'Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple of things before I get you out of here.'\n'I mean, doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose of having a your own plane if it departs before you arrive.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark and Pepper Potts|'What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, do you got plans?'\n'As a matter of fact, I do.'\n'I don’t like it when you have plans.'\n'I’m allowed to have plans on my birthday.'\n'It’s your birthday?'\n'Yes.'\n'I knew that. Already?'\n'Yeah, isn’t that strange? It’s the same day as last year.'\n'Well, get yourself something nice from me.'\n'I already did.'\n'And?'\n'Oh, it was very nice. Very tasteful. Thank you Mr. Stark.'\n'You’re welcome Miss Potts.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark and Ho Yinsen|'The hell did you do to me?'\n'What I did? What I did was to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could; there's a lot left and it's headed into your atrial septum. Here wanna see? Souvenir. Take a look. I've seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the 'walking dead', because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.'\n'What is this?'\n'That is an electromagnet hooked up to a car battery, and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.'
Iron Man|Ho Yinsen and Tony Stark|'We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.'\n'I don't remember.'\n'No you wouldn't. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark and Ho Yinsen|'Got a family?'\n'Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?'\n'No.'\n'No. So you're a man who has everything, and nothing.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark and Pepper Potts|'Your eyes are red. Tears for your long lost boss?'\n'Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.'\n'Yeah, vacation's over.'
Iron Man|Pepper Potts and Tony Stark|'Tony, you have to go to the hospital. The doctor has to look at you.'\n'I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. One, I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...'\n'That's enough of that.'\n'Is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.'\n'Call for a press conference? What on earth for?'\n'Yeah, Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.'
Iron Man|Reporter and Tony Stark|'What happened over there?'\n'Uh, I— I had my eyes open. I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just making things to blow up, and that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacture division of Stark International, until such a time as I can decide what the future of this company will be. What direction it should take. One that I'm comfortable with, and is consistent with the highest good of this country as well.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.|'J.A.R.V.I.S., are you up?'\n'For you sir, always.'\n'I'd like to open a new project file, index as: Mark 2.'\n'Shall I store this on the Stark Industries' central database?'\n'I don't know who to trust right now. 'Til further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server.'\n'Working on a secret project, are we, sir?'\n'I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine it could actually do some good.'
Iron Man|J.A.R.V.I.S. and Tony Stark|'Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics...'\n'Uh, yeah, tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check, start listening in on ground control.'\n'Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations required before an actual flight is...'\n'J.A.R.V.I.S., sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.'
Iron Man|Phil Coulson and Tony Stark|'Mr. Stark.'\n'Yeah?'\n'Agent Coulson.'\n'Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the guy from the...'\n'Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.'\n'Whew! God, you really need a new name for that.'\n'Yeah, I hear that a lot.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark and J.A.R.V.I.S.|'Tell you what, throw a little hot rod red in there.'\n'Yes, that shall help you keep a low profile.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark and Pepper Potts|'You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. Now that I'm trying to protect the people I've put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?'\n'You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it.'
Iron Man|Obadiah Stane and Tony Stark|'You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!'\n'How'd you solve the icing problem?'\n'Icing problem?'\n'Might want to look into it.'
Iron Man|Tony Stark and James Rhodes|'I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.'\n'Just stick to the cards, man.'\n'Yeah, okay. The truth is... I am Iron Man.'
Iron Man|Nick Fury and Tony Stark|'You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet.'\n'Who the hell are you?'\n'Nick Fury. Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.'\n'Ah.'\n'I'm here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative.'
The Incredible Hulk|Tony Stark and Thaddeus Ross|'The smell of stale beer... and defeat. You know, I hate to say 'I told you so,' but that Super-Soldier project WAS put on ice for a reason. I've always felt that hardware was much more reliable.'\n'Stark.'\n'General.'\n'You always wear such nice suits.'
