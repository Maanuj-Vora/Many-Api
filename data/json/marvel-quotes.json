And he says \"You.\" He says \"You will make us strong.\" Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he's ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist. Schmidt must become that superior man.\"\"Did it make him stronger?\"\"Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.\"\"Thanks. I think.\"\"Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.\"\"To the little guys.\"\"No. No. Wait. Wait.

Why go along with this?\"\"Because you've been brainwashed!\"\"Oh, that's hilarious coming from someone who grew up inside of a cult!\"\"Just... think about it. Every time someone mentions the Hand, you freak out. You run off to the docks or... or to buildings filled with fighters without a second thought. Why? Because you grew up in a place hearing one story about us and nobody ever questioned that view. I understand. But those were lies shoved down your throat when you were a kid...\"\"No. No.\"\"by people who live in the past. Just consider for a moment that maybe... just maybe... they got it wrong.\"\"No.\"\"Danny, this is my family.\"\"And my family are dead because of your family.\"\"You're not listening.

Sometimes the delineation between the two is a sharp line, sometimes it's a blur. And often it's like pornography; you just know when you see it. A man is dead. I don't mean to make light of that, but these questions, these questions are vital ones, because they tether us to each other, to humanity. Not everyone feels this way. Not everyone sees the sharp line, only the blur. A man is dead. A man is dead. And my client, John Healy, took his life. This is not a dispute. It is a matter of record. A fact. And facts have no moral judgment; they merely state what is. Not what we think of them, not what we feel, they just are. What was in my clients heart when he took Mr. Prohaszka's life, whether he is a good man or something else entirely, is irrelevant. These questions of good and evil, as important as they are, have no place in a court of law. Only the facts matter. My client claims he acted in self-defense. Mr. Prohaszka's associates have refused to make a statement regarding the incident. The only other witness, a frightened young woman, has stated that my client was pleasent and friendly. And she only saw the struggle with Mr. Prohaszka after it had started. Those are the facts. Based on these, and these alone, the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that my client was not acting solely in self-defense, and those, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, are the facts. My client, based purely on the sanctity of the law, which we've all sworn an oath to uphold, must be acquitted of these charges. Now, beyond that, beyond these walls, he may well face a judgment of his own making. But here, in this courtroom the judgment is yours, and yours alone.\""

Standing up to a man who used fear as a tool to set neighbors against one another. If Father Lantom had an enemy, I would say it was fear. For me, personally, he spent many years trying to get me to face my own fears. To understand how they enslaved me, how they divided me from the people that I love.

I was here in America for my big break. And this would be the TV pilot for the CBS network. Caged Heat. Wonderful piece, about avenging Russian police cop with anger issues let loose on Los Angeles. I wish I had a copy. I wish I had copy.\"\"Actually, Trevor, I managed to find some footage of that as well.\"\"Oh, oh, oh. Handsome lad. Handsome lad. Yeah, it's compelling. Sean Connery made a pass at me once. Everyone on the set called him \"Mr. Connery.\" He called me \"Trev.\" \"You're very talented, Trev.\"\"\"That's fascinating. Was that a monkey drinking vodka?\"\"Yes. Yes! And still those knobs at the network didn't pick it up. I think it was too sophisticated for them.\"\"Hmm.\"\"That was the break that broke me.\"\"Well, right there. You seem to typify your life as a series of missed opportunities, but yet, you don't tend to take responsibility for many of them.\"\"My responsibility is to my muse. I'm an actor, love, not a bloody rocket surgeon.\"\"Hmm. But, possibly, your portrayal has angered some people. I mean, some whom are very dangerous.\"\"You don't have to tell me, mate. I've seen those bloody Internet message boards. Vicious.\"\"I'm not talking about the message boards. I'm talking about the Ten Rings.\"\"Come again?\"\"The terrorist group historically associated with the Mandarin. Officially they're dormant, but evidence suggests that they're becoming more active.\"\"What, the Ten Rings? Are they real?\"\"It's well documented.\"\"That is so cool.\""

Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That’s not fair. That’s not right. And it’s just too bad. Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink! Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military: The Hammer drone. Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That’s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war.

He listened to their problems. And he made them feel better about the world and themselves. We have to strive on a daily basis to do the same for each other.

The militia liked to force Hutu villagers to murder their neighbors... with machetes. But nobody would raise a hand against Gahiji.

Gahiji didn't try to put up a fight. Just asked for the chance to say goodbye to his family. By the time he was done, even the soldiers didn't wanna kill him. So they went to their commander and asked permission to shoot him. At least give him a quick death. The commander wanted to meet this man... who had won the respect of so many. He went to Gahiji... talked with him in his hut... for many hours. Then he dragged him out in front of his village and hacked him to pieces... along with his entire family.
